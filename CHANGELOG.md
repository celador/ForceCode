    * Add ability to change settings for static resources (Per resource) via using a `forceBundleSettings.json` file in the `resource-bundle` folder. This file will be auto-generated upon save of a static resource. If the resource exists in the org, the current settings of the resource will be used in the file.
    * Update Slack invite link #357
    * Fix issue saving binary static resource files (JPG, PNG, etc)
* 3.22.1
    * Transitioned delete functionality to SFDX. Now more types are supported for deleting from an org.
* 3.22.0
    * Add ignore functionality via the Forcecode `force.filesExclude` workspace setting. This can be used when deploying files to ignore files/folders. Forcecode now also respects `.forceignore` files in your workspace root as well. A `.forceignore` file will always supersede the `force.filesExclude` workspace setting. When choosing files to deploy, the ignore settings will be respected as well (Ignored files won't show in the list of files to choose from).
    * Add ability to remove source from org. Aura component pieces can be removed individually or as a whole. If you delete the Aura component's `cmp`, `app`, etc file or the `-meta.xml` file then the whole bundle will be removed from the org. When deleting an LWC, the whole bundle will ALWAYS be removed!
        * Currently, delete functionality is limited only to certain metadata (All metadata that can be created via the `New` menu option is supported and a few others). If you receive an error stating that the metadata wasn't found in the org and you are sure it is indeed there, then the type is not currently supported for deletion by Forcecode

Click on the dropdown next to a class name in the `Sufficient Coverage` or `Insufficient Coverage` section and you will be presented with a list of test classes and methods that cover your class. Clicking on one of these will open the tested class and update the coverage decorations to show you visually which lines are covered by each. This addresses the issue `Show test classes covering my class.` #329. Thanks @Caio-Carvalho for the request for this!
* 3.19.2
    * Fix `LightningMessageChannel not supported` #336. The `Production / Developer` option when logging into a new org has been split into separate options. For existing projects, if you want to try out the LightningMessageCenter Beta feature, you will need to open your Org Settings in the Forcecode menu and check the isDeveloperEdition checkbox then save in order to open Lightning Message Center files.
